.oO JAVA-MONKEY Oo.

Java-Monkey needs FtpBean.
You need to download the latest version from http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/9129/javabean/ftpbean/ and put it into <Your Java-Dir>/jre/lib/ext

To compile type this:
  javac FtpClass.java
  javac Main.java

To run this:
  java Main <IP-Range>

An IP-Range is something like this: 192.168.0.*

If you like this program, send me an Pub-IP (E-Mail see below).

Have fun,
Giuly <giuly AT giuly DOTde>
